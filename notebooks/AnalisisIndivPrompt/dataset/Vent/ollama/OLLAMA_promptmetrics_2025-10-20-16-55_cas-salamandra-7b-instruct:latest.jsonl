He was the son of Prince Baldwin of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, and his second wife, Alice of Antioch.\n\nHe became count in 1185 after his brother, Manasses III, Count of Tripoli, had abdicated due to poor health. His rule as Count did not last long because he was killed on December 20, 1187 during the Battle of Cresson by Saladin's forces.\n\nRaymond is considered an important figure in the Crusader states for his role in strengthening the city-states against their enemies and expanding Christian influence into what is now known as Lebanon and Syria. He worked with other leaders such as Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, who helped to form a united front against Muslim forces that threatened their territories.\n\nDespite his death at Cresson, Raymond III remains an important figure in history because he played a key role in shaping the future of the Crusader states during his time as Count of Tripoli.", "prompt_id": 0}
