Known for his military and diplomatic skills, he played a significant role in the history of the Crusader states during the Second Crusade.\n\n**Highlighted section part 1: Early life and accession**\n\nRaymond was the son of Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, and Constance of Antioch.

During this period, the Muslim forces of Zengi were expanding in Syria, threatening the Crusader states.\n\n**Highlighted section part 2: Military campaigns and Second Crusade**\n\nRaymond III quickly established himself as a skilled military leader. He led several successful campaigns against the Muslims, capturing Tortosa and Beirut, and repelling an attack on Tripoli by Zengi's forces in 1157. In 1160, he played a key role in the Battle of Harim, which resulted in the defeat of the Byzantine Empire and the loss of their territories in northern Syria to the Crusader states.\n\nIn 1147, Raymond participated in the Second Crusade, leading a fleet to aid the Crusaders besieging Damietta in Egypt.
